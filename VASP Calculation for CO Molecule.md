### Analysis of VASP Calculation Results

#### Energy Values for Different O Positions in CO Molecule

**Extracted Energy Values:**

| O Position (Å) | Energy (eV)        |
|----------------|---------------------|
| 0.9            | -14.5               |
| 1.0            | -14.6               |
| 1.1            | -14.7               |
| 1.2            | -14.68              |
| 1.3            | -14.66              |

**Observations:**

1. **Minimum Energy Configuration:**
   - The energy values decrease as the O atom is positioned from 0.9 Å to 1.1 Å, reaching a minimum at 1.1 Å with an energy of -14.7 eV.
   - Beyond 1.1 Å, the energy increases slightly, indicating that 1.1 Å is the most stable position for the O atom in the CO molecule within the tested range.

2. **Comparison with Experimental Value:**
   - The minimum energy position (1.1 Å) is close to the experimental C-O bond distance of 1.12 Å.
   - This indicates that the VASP calculations are consistent with experimental observations and accurately predict the optimal bond length.

**Conclusion:**

- The VASP calculations effectively determine the optimal position of the O atom in a CO molecule, with the minimum energy observed at 1.1 Å.
- This position is in close agreement with the experimental bond length, validating the accuracy of the computational approach.
- Such calculations are essential for understanding molecular structures and can be extended to more complex systems for predicting stable configurations and properties.

### The difference of OC20 and OC22

The Open Catalyst 2022 (OC22) and Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) datasets are initiatives designed to support the development of machine learning models for catalysis, particularly in the prediction of catalyst properties and reactions. Here's a comparison between them based on the provided documents:

1. **Scope and Focus**:
   - **OC20** primarily targeted systems that included a variety of small adsorbates (such as C1/C2 compounds and N/O-containing intermediates) on low Miller index facets of stable materials from the Materials Project. It aimed to advance the accuracy and generalizability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by providing a broad dataset for training.
   - **OC22** expands on the foundations of OC20 by incorporating a large dataset of oxide materials, which are crucial for reactions like the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). Oxides present unique challenges due to their complex surface chemistries and electronic structures, making them more difficult to model with computational methods that were effective for simpler metal systems .

2. **Dataset Composition and Use**:
   - **OC20** involved about 250 million single-point calculations, helping to rapidly advance GNN accuracy in catalysis by offering a diverse range of adsorbate and material combinations.
   - **OC22** includes 62,331 Density Functional Theory (DFT) relaxations, amounting to approximately 9,854,504 single point calculations. This dataset focuses on oxide materials, covering various material compositions, surface terminations, and adsorbate configurations .

3. **Applications and Impact**:
   - **OC20** facilitated the development and fine-tuning of models that could predict adsorption energies and other properties relevant to catalytic processes, leveraging its extensive data variety.
   - **OC22** is designed to not only supplement the materials and reactions covered by OC20 but also to extend the application of machine learning models to more chemically and structurally complex oxide systems. It emphasizes the importance of addressing long-range electrostatic and magnetic interactions, which are critical for accurately modeling oxide surfaces .

4. **Model Training and Innovation**:
   - Both datasets encourage the development of models using techniques like transfer learning, where models pretrained on OC20 could be fine-tuned using OC22 data, thereby improving performance across different datasets. This approach leverages the foundational data of OC20 while enhancing model capabilities with the new and more complex challenges presented by OC22 .

These comparisons highlight how OC22 builds upon and differs from OC20, aiming to cover gaps in data and complexity that OC20 did not address, particularly in the context of oxide catalysis and more complex reaction dynamics.

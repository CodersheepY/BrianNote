# Analysis of Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Different Parameters

### Examining several conditions (size, trajectory length)

### Simulation 1: Size = 4, Trajectory Length = 1

- **Size**: 4
- **Trajectory Length**: 1 ps

### Simulation 2: Size = 6, Trajectory Length = 2

- **Size**: 6
- **Trajectory Length**: 2 ps

### System Size (Size)

The system size determines the total number of atoms in the simulation. By changing the replication factor of the crystal structure, you can control the physical size of the system.

**Purpose**:

- Increasing the `replicate_size` improves statistical significance, reduces boundary effects, and makes the simulation more representative of real-world conditions.

**Reasons**:

- Smaller systems are more susceptible to boundary effects and may not accurately reflect the macroscopic properties of the material. Larger systems provide more atoms, ensuring the results are more representative.
- Larger systems can capture more atomic interactions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the material's dynamic and thermodynamic properties.

### Trajectory Length

The trajectory length determines the total simulation time. By setting the maximum simulation time, you can capture atomic movements over a longer timescale.

**Purpose**:

- Extending the simulation time allows for capturing more atomic movement processes, especially those occurring over longer timescales, such as slow dynamic behaviors.
- This improves the reliability of statistical analysis, ensuring the system reaches thermal equilibrium and observing the system's behavior in a steady state.

**Reasons**:

- Shorter simulation times may not fully capture atomic movements, especially for slow processes like diffusion, potentially leading to inaccurate diffusion coefficients.
- Extending the simulation time generates more data points, improving the reliability of statistical analysis and ensuring accurate calculation of mean squared displacement (MSD) and diffusion coefficients.

### Detailed Comparison and Insights

### Simulation 1: Size = 4, Trajectory Length = 1

- **Temperature [K]**: 1000
- **Maximum time [ps]**: 1.1 (discard initial 0.1 ps)
- **Number of steps**: 11199 (calculate), 1119 (write to trajectory)
- **Diffusion coefficient**:

$$
D = 2.3621 \times 10^{-3} \text{ cm}^2/\text{s}
$$

**Observations**:

- Smaller system size (4) results in a less extensive simulation setup.
- Shorter trajectory length (1 ps) means fewer atomic movements are captured, potentially leading to a higher diffusion coefficient.

### Analysis

- **Impact of Size and Trajectory Length**:
    - In the **first simulation**, with a smaller system size (4) and a shorter trajectory (1 ps), the smaller system might not reflect the macroscopic properties of the material as effectively, and the short trajectory length may not capture all relevant diffusion processes adequately, leading to a higher estimated diffusion coefficient.
    - In the **second simulation**, with a larger system size (6) and a longer trajectory (2 ps), the larger system may provide a broader space and more atoms, capturing finer atomic movements, resulting in a lower diffusion coefficient. The longer trajectory length allows the system more time to approach thermal equilibrium, potentially reflecting more realistic diffusion behavior.

### Conclusions

- Differences in diffusion coefficients are primarily driven by the variations in system size and simulation time. Larger system sizes and longer trajectory lengths generally provide more accurate simulations that are closer to real physical environments.
- When designing simulation parameters, it's essential to adjust the system size and trajectory length according to the characteristics of the material being studied and the experimental objectives to more accurately estimate diffusion coefficients.
- The results suggest that for simulations requiring precise analysis of diffusion behaviors, it is advisable to choose larger system sizes and longer simulation times to minimize boundary effects and increase the statistical significance of the data.

### BUGs

### Issue 1: Problems with Running Scripts Directly from PyCharm

- **Problem Description**: Encountered errors when trying to run scripts directly using the PyCharm run button.
- **Solution Implemented**: A new virtual environment was established, and subsequent script executions were conducted through PyCharm's terminal. This ensured that all environmental variables and dependencies were correctly loaded.

### Issue 2: Bugs Related to Environment Creation

- **Problem Description**: Initial attempts to set up the project environment encountered bugs due to dependency conflicts or missing packages.
- **Solution Implemented**: Modified the environment setup process by including specific package installation commands that bypass the usual index lookup. This was necessary for correctly installing certain Python packages that are critical for the project, particularly those related to PyTorch Geometric.

pip install --no-index torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f <https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.2.2+cpu.html>

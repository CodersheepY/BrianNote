***What is Density Functional Theory***
1. **Density**: Electron Density
2. **Functional**: Energy as a function of Electron Density. By minimizing the energy functional, one can obtain the ground-state electron density and the corresponding energy of the system.
3. **Electron Density**: A function of spatial coordinates.
4. **Functional**: A function of a function.
5. **Density Functional Theory**: A method for studying the electronic structure of multi-electron systems (describing the properties and behavior of atoms and molecules) through electron density. The electronic motion equations are no longer the Schr√∂dinger equation (whose wave function represents the solution to a many-body problem that is difficult to solve in practical situations), but are instead solved in terms of the electron density, simplifying the computational process.

# Surface Relaxation

Imagine a piece of metal that is cut in half, creating two new surfaces. How do the atoms on these newly created surfaces differ from those in the bulk?

First, the atoms on the surface have fewer coordination numbers compared to the atoms in the bulk, meaning surface atoms have dangling bonds. The cutting process essentially breaks the bonds between the surface atoms and their neighbors. Additionally, the reduction in coordination increases the interaction between the surface layer and the internal layers, making it different from the bulk. This change is reflected in the interlayer distance (bond length).

In an ideal scenario, a crystal extends infinitely in all directions, with each atom's equilibrium position determined by the total force exerted by all other atoms in the crystal. As a result, every atom in the ideal crystal occupies an equivalent position, and the generated crystal structure is periodic. However, in reality, the size of the crystal is finite. This leads to the atoms near the crystal surface experiencing forces that differ from those acting on atoms in the interior, resulting in different atomic arrangements on the crystal surface compared to the bulk.

The behavior of surface atoms in a crystal can be categorized into two types: **relaxation** and **reconstruction**.

- **Relaxation** refers to the overall positional shift of the surface atomic layers relative to the bulk. A common form is **normal relaxation**, which involves vertical displacements, or movement in the direction normal to the surface. This is the most frequent type of relaxation observed on metal surfaces. In some materials, tangential relaxation may occur alongside normal relaxation.
